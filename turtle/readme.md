## turtle.js

turtle.js is a versatile JavaScript library that enables you to create dynamic and interactive graphics on your webpage. By including this lightweight script in your HTML page along with a `<canvas id="my-canvas">` element, you can get started with drawing on your canvas using a turtle.

This library offers a range of functions including `line`, `dot`, `forward`, `turnLeft`, and `turnRight`. Additionally, it provides customization options such as `context.strokeStyle`, `context.lineWidth`, and `sleepDuration` that allow you to fine-tune the behavior of your turtle and achieve the desired effect.

## turtle_.py

The python script `turtle_.py` binds keys to turtle movement so you can use your keyboard to draw your turtle. To run run the script:

```bash
py turtle_.py
```

When it starts, key commands will be printed in your terminal and a window should pop up for you to draw in.
