# Yield Curve

Load `yieldCurve.html` in your browser and it will scrape the most recent treasury yields from FRED and plot them for you.

It uses a public CORS proxy, meaning you may have to activate demo cors. You can check the console to see if you got an error if it fails to load and follow the instructions there.
